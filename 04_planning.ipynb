        "# 📘 Agentic Architectures 4: Planning\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we explore the **Planning** architecture. This pattern introduces a crucial layer of foresight into an agent's reasoning process. Instead of reacting to information step-by-step as in the ReAct model, a planning agent first decomposes a complex task into a sequence of smaller, manageable sub-goals. It creates a full 'battle plan' *before* taking any action.\n",
        "\n",
        "This proactive approach brings structure, predictability, and efficiency to multi-step tasks. To highlight its benefits, we will directly compare the performance of a **reactive agent (ReAct)** against our new **planning agent**. We will present both with a task that requires gathering multiple pieces of information before performing a final calculation, demonstrating how a pre-computed plan can lead to a more robust and direct solution."

        "### Definition\n",
        "The **Planning** architecture involves an agent that explicitly breaks down a complex goal into a detailed sequence of sub-tasks *before* beginning execution. The output of this initial planning phase is a concrete, step-by-step plan that the agent then follows methodically to reach the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### High-level Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Receive Goal:** The agent is given a complex task.\n",
        "2.  **Plan:** A dedicated 'Planner' component analyzes the goal and generates an ordered list of sub-tasks required to achieve it. For example: `[\"Find fact A\", \"Find fact B\", \"Calculate C using A and B\"]`.\n",
        "3.  **Execute:** An 'Executor' component takes the plan and carries out each sub-task in sequence, using tools as needed.\n",
        "4.  **Synthesize:** Once all steps in the plan are complete, a final component synthesizes the results from the executed steps into a coherent final answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use / Applications\n",
        "*   **Multi-Step Workflows:** Ideal for tasks where the sequence of operations is known and critical, such as generating a report that requires fetching data, processing it, and then summarizing it.\n",
        "*   **Project Management Assistants:** Decomposing a large goal like \"launch a new feature\" into sub-tasks for different teams.\n",
        "*   **Educational Tutoring:** Creating a lesson plan to teach a student a specific concept, from foundational principles to advanced application.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
        "*   **Strengths:**\n",
        "    *   **Structured & Traceable:** The entire workflow is laid out in advance, making the agent's process transparent and easy to debug.\n",
        "    *   **Efficient:** Can be more efficient than ReAct for predictable tasks, as it avoids unnecessary reasoning loops between steps.\n",
        "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
        "    *   **Brittle to Change:** A pre-made plan can fail if the environment changes unexpectedly during execution. It's less adaptive than a ReAct agent, which can change its mind after every step."

Both agents can receive a high `task_completion_score` if they find the answer. The **Planning Agent** should receive a significantly higher `process_efficiency_score` because its transcript shows a single planning phase then sequential execution, whereas the ReAct agent's transcript shows multiple reactive think-search-think cycles.

By forcing an agent to first construct a comprehensive plan before execution, we gain significant benefits in transparency, robustness, and efficiency for well-defined, multi-step tasks.\n",

        "While ReAct excels in exploratory scenarios where the next step is unknown, Planning shines when the path to a solution can be charted in advance. Understanding this trade-off is crucial for a system designer. Choosing the right architecture for the right problem is a key skill in building effective and intelligent AI agents. The Planning pattern is an essential tool in that toolkit, providing the structure needed for complex, predictable workflows."
