        "\n",
        "Welcome to the first notebook in our deep dive into the 21 key agentic architectures. We begin with one of the most fundamental and powerful patterns: **Reflection**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This pattern elevates a Large Language Model (LLM) from a simple, single-pass generator into a more deliberate and robust reasoner. Instead of just providing the first answer it comes up with, a reflective agent takes a step back to critique, analyze, and refine its own work. This iterative process of self-improvement is a cornerstone of building more reliable and higher-quality AI systems."

      "id": "intro-definition",
      "metadata": {},
      "source": [
        "### Definition\n",
        "The **Reflection** architecture involves an agent critiquing and revising its own output before returning a final answer. Instead of a single-pass generation, it engages in a multi-step internal monologue: produce, evaluate, and improve. This mimics the human process of drafting, reviewing, and editing to catch errors and enhance quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### High-level Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Generate:** The agent produces an initial draft or solution based on the user's prompt.\n",
        "2.  **Critique:** The agent then switches roles to become a critic. It asks itself questions like: *\"What could be wrong with this answer?\"*, *\"What is missing?\"*, *\"Is this solution optimal?\"*, or *\"Are there any logical flaws or bugs?\"*.\n",
        "3.  **Refine:** Using the insights from its self-critique, the agent generates a final, improved version of the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use / Applications\n",
        "*   **Code Generation:** The initial code might have bugs, be inefficient, or lack comments. Reflection allows the agent to act as its own code reviewer, catching errors and improving style before presenting the final script.\n",
        "*   **Complex Summarization:** When summarizing dense documents, a first pass might miss nuances or omit key details. A reflection step helps ensure the summary is comprehensive and accurate.\n",
        "*   **Creative Writing & Content Creation:** The first draft of an email, blog post, or story can always be improved. Reflection allows the agent to refine its tone, clarity, and impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
        "*   **Strengths:**\n",
        "    *   **Improved Quality:** Directly addresses and corrects errors, leading to more accurate, robust, and well-reasoned outputs.\n",
        "    *   **Low Overhead:** It's a conceptually simple pattern that can be implemented with a single LLM and doesn't require complex external tools.\n",
        "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
        "    *   **Self-Bias:** The agent is still limited by its own knowledge and biases. If it doesn't know a better way to solve a problem, it can't critique its way to a better solution. It can fix flaws it recognizes but can't invent knowledge it lacks.\n",
        "    *   **Increased Latency & Cost:** The process involves at least two LLM calls (generation + critique/refinement), making it slower and more expensive than a single-pass approach."

Many models first write trial division (for each number 2..n, check if it’s prime), which is correct but O(n √n). The critic can suggest the Sieve of Eratosthenes; the refiner then produces an O(n log log n) solution. We never ask for the slow version; reflection surfaces and fixes it. We *measure* both versions on the same n to show the improvement."

We used a task—counting primes ≤ n—where the obvious first implementation is often trial division (correct but slow). We did not ask for that; the model chose it. The critic suggests the Sieve of Eratosthenes; the refiner implements it. We **measured** both versions so the improvement is quantitative and honest.\n",

By structuring the process into **Generate**, **Critique**, and **Refine** and orchestrating it with LangGraph, we get a system that can find and fix its own flaws—a foundational pattern for building more deliberate and reliable AI systems."
