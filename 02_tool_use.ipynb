        "This notebook covers the second, and arguably one of the most transformative, agentic architectures: **Tool Use**. This pattern is the bridge that connects a Large Language Model's reasoning capabilities to the real, dynamic world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without tools, an LLM is a closed system, limited by the knowledge frozen into its training data. It cannot know today's weather, the current price of a stock, or the status of an order in your company's database. By giving an agent the ability to use tools, we empower it to overcome this fundamental limitation, allowing it to query APIs, search databases, and access live information to provide answers that are not just reasoned, but also factual, timely, and relevant."

        "### Definition\n",
        "The **Tool Use** architecture equips an LLM-powered agent with the ability to call external functions or APIs (the \"tools\"). The agent autonomously decides when a user's query cannot be answered by its internal knowledge alone and determines which tool is appropriate to call to find the necessary information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### High-level Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Receive Query:** The agent receives a request from the user.\n",
        "2.  **Decision:** The agent analyzes the query and its available tools. It decides if a tool is needed to answer the question accurately.\n",
        "3.  **Action:** If a tool is needed, the agent formats a call to that tool (e.g., a specific function with the right arguments).\n",
        "4.  **Observation:** The system executes the tool call, and the result (the \"observation\") is returned to the agent.\n",
        "5.  **Synthesis:** The agent integrates the tool's output into its reasoning process to generate a final, grounded answer for the user.\n",
        "\n",

        "*   **Research Assistants:** Answering questions that require up-to-the-minute information by using a web search API.\n",
        "*   **Enterprise Assistants:** Querying internal company databases to answer questions like \"How many new users signed up last week?\"\n",
        "*   **Scientific & Mathematical Tasks:** Using a calculator or a computational engine like WolframAlpha for precise calculations that LLMs often struggle with.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
        "*   **Strengths:**\n",
        "    *   **Factual Grounding:** Drastically reduces hallucinations by fetching real, live data.\n",
        "    *   **Extensibility:** The agent's capabilities can be continuously expanded by simply adding new tools.\n",
        "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
        "    *   **Integration Overhead:** Requires careful \"plumbing\" to define tools, handle API keys, and manage potential tool failures.\n",
        "    *   **Tool Trust:** The quality of the agent's answer is dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the tools it uses. The agent must trust that its tools provide correct information."

By connecting our agent to live, external information, we have fundamentally overcome the limitation of static training data. The agent is no longer just a reasoner; it is a researcher, capable of providing answers that are grounded, factual, and current. This architecture is a foundational building block for creating virtually any practical, real-world AI assistant."
